## **Clustering**

Clustering is a machine learning method used to find structure in large datasets by grouping similar objects together. It's an unsupervised learning technique that is widely used in various areas of data analysis and serves as the foundation for the data handling in this project.

## **Application**

This project applies clustering methodology to job market data, web-scrapped from local job posting website, offering promising avenues for:

- **Educational institutions:** They can leverage the insights provided to tailor their courses and train students in skills that are most relevant and in demand in the current job market.
- **Job seekers and career counselors:** They can understand the trending professions and skill requirements, which can help in making informed career decisions.

## **Technologies**

This project is implemented using Python for data collection and analysis, along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the data visualization.
